# 🚁 Drone Delivery Optimization Algorithm 🌍

## Problem Statement
Imagine you're a delivery company with multiple drones that need to deliver packages to different locations. How can you find the most efficient route that:
- Minimizes total travel distance
- Reduces fuel consumption
- Delivers all packages quickly

## Real World Scenarios
- Emergency medical supply delivery
- Agricultural crop monitoring
- Disaster relief package distribution
- E-commerce rapid delivery systems

## Solution: Grid-Based Drone Route Optimization 🗺️

### Algorithm Approach
Our algorithm uses a smart path-finding technique that:
1. Converts delivery locations into a grid
2. Calculates optimal paths
3. Minimizes total drone travel distance
